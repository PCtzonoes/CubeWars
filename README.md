# CubeWars

It is a simple game using the Unity Game Engine, that I plan to use to increase my familiarity in coding in C#, using the Unity engine and using Git for version control
--------------------
To keep things simple for now the game has a small area with four enemies that have to be defeaten, the player can shoot and so too can the enemies
